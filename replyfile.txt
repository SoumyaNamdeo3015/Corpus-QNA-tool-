Based on the excerpts provided, Mahatma Gandhi's views on the partition of India can be inferred as follows:

1. Gandhi saw partition as something that should not be accepted or considered good. He expressed his opposition to the partition proposal and called it an untruth, stating that there can be no compromise with it. He considered the vivisection of India (partition) to be a sin.

2. Gandhi believed that the introduction of separate electorates and the curse of communalism intensified the demand for partition. He argued against thinking in terms of separate electorates and two nations, emphasizing the need for unity and the innate goodness of human nature.

3. Gandhi believed that a Constituent Assembly, through a responsible and final decision, could potentially resolve the deadlock and decide the fate of millions of people. He saw the Constituent Assembly as a reality and opposed the fear of either multiple partitions or civil war if the Muslim vote went in favor of partition.

4. Gandhi considered untouchability to be the root cause of Hindu-Muslim discord and India's downfall. He regarded it as a curse of Hinduism and believed that it should be renounced in all forms. He emphasized the importance of eradicating untouchability for the Satyagraha Sena (nonviolent army) and for Hindu-Muslim unity.

Overall, Gandhi's views on partition were firmly against its acceptance and saw it as a divisive and harmful concept for the unity and well-being of India.
